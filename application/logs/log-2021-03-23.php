It’s\r\nfrustrating for graduates and young professionals to search tirelessly for jobs\r\nthat are at their skill level, but why aren’t ‘entry-level’ jobs really </span><i style=\"font-family: &quot;Gotham Rounded Book&quot;; font-size: 1rem;\">entry</i><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Gotham Rounded Book&quot;; font-size: 1rem;\">\r\nlevel?</span><br></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Gotham Rounded Book&quot;\">Nowadays,\r\ninternships have taken the place of entry-level jobs. It’s no longer enough to\r\nsimply study hard and get your certificate or degree, you have to volunteer\r\nalongside this, get an unpaid internship while you work on your final project.\r\nIt’s no longer enough for a young professional to hand their Bachelor’s degree\r\nto a company and get hired. While this is discouraging, there is plenty you can\r\ndo to enhance your CV and increase your chances of landing an entry-level job!<o:p></o:p></span></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><b><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Gotham Rounded Book&quot;\">Do\r\nvolunteer work:<o:p></o:p></span></b></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Gotham Rounded Book&quot;\">Whether\r\nindustry-focused or not, doing volunteer work will have you gaining skills and\r\nexperience that you can add to your CV and that are transferrable to various\r\nopportunities. For example, working in customer service will give you\r\nexperience managing and building relationships, which will be transferrable to\r\na client-facing job in the future. It’s all about how to relate those skills to\r\nyour goals. <o:p></o:p></span></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Gotham Rounded Book&quot;\">Being\r\nin-between roles or new to the working world is a great time to try out online\r\ncourses. This will fill gaps in your career, whilst also bettering your\r\nskillset to suit your goals.

Keep a blog and add a\r\nlink to that on your CV, write LinkedIn articles about issues that matter to\r\nyou and pin these to your profile. It’s all about making your skills visible\r\nand accessible to potential employers. If you’re a creative, put your work\r\nonline, practice video editing for your own social media, start your own\r\nYouTube channel to display your work! It doesn’t have to be part of a company\r\nto be part of your experience!<o:p></o:p></span></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><b><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Gotham Rounded Book&quot;\">Don’t\r\nforget, you’re at the beginning:<o:p></o:p></span></b></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Gotham Rounded Book&quot;\">It’s easy to\r\nbe on the brink of graduating, or job-searching for several months on the hunt\r\nfor your dream job. But you’re only just starting out. The start of your career\r\nis all about experience and finding those stepping-stones to lead you in the\r\nright direction. We cannot simply expect to hand an employer our degrees and be\r\ngiven the opportunity of a lifetime, it’s all part of a journey, and not\r\nsomething to beat yourself up about. Whether or not your first job is in your\r\nfield, or even something you particularly saw yourself doing long-term, see\r\nthese roles as an opportunity to learn new skills and translate these into what\r\nyou hope to do one day.<o:p></o:p></span></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Gotham Rounded Book&quot;\">It can be\r\ndisheartening, searching endlessly for jobs in a society where so many others\r\nare doing the same, many of which being more experienced professionals that\r\nhave found themselves in unemployment due to the pandemic. But you are at the\r\nbeginning, and the pandemic hasn’t been a kind influence on the job market. Use\r\nthe time you aren’t tied down in a job to explore your career goals, look at\r\nyour experience and learn new skills. A rejection, while unsettling, comes with\r\na silver lining. Always request feedback, this can be useful for future\r\napplications. interview experience is always a confidence builder. While you\r\nmight not land the job you are building a network of people in your industry\r\nand making yourself a more knowledgeable candidate for what employers are\r\nlooking for. <o:p></o:p></span></p><p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Gotham Rounded Book&quot;\">A final tip\r\nis something I find personally helpful – I have always found it useful to\r\nremind myself that what will be, will be.
